    Finance::Account::Archive - Database support for account data

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Account::Archive;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface to PostgreSQL/MySQL databases for
    storing account/financial information. It uses the "finances" table
    (so named by default), and provides the ability to run interactively
    with the user, as well as query, insert, update, and delete
    operations.
